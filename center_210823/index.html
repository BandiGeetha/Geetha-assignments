!--SCRIPTING LANGUAGE:A scripting language is a programming language that is interpreted. It is translated into machine code when the code is run, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for short scripts over full computer programs. JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are all examples of scripting languages.07-Nov-2022<br>
Scripting languages use a program known as an interpreter to translate commands and are directly interpreted from source code, not requiring a compilation step. Other programming languages, on the other hand, may require a compiler to translate commands into machine code before it can execute those commands. 

It is important to know the difference between interpreted vs compiled programming languages to expand your understanding of coding. However, advanced hardware and coding practices are beginning to make the distinction somewhat obsolete. Overall, scripting languages are used to provide directions to software programs, like those within websites.<br>
In this section, we will provide examples of server-side scripting languages and notable details about them. Learn more about PHP, Java, and Perl scripting languages, among others, in the table below.

markup language:A markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts. Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.<br>
A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML.

HTML is a markup language used for creating webpages. The contents of each webpage are defined by HTML tags. Basic page tags, such as <head>, <body>, and <div> define sections of the page, while tags such as <table>, <form>, <image>, and <a> define elements within the page. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. For example, a link to the TechTerms.com home page may use the following HTML code:

XML is used for storing structured data, rather than formatting information on a page. While HTML documents use predefined tags (like the examples above), XML files use custom tags to define elements. For example, an XML file that stores information about computer models may include the following section:

programming language:A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code, or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical<br>
A program is a set of instructions that help computer to perform tasks. This set of instructions is also called as scripts. Programs are executed by processor whereas scripts are interpreted. The languages that are used to write a program or set of instructions are called "Programming languages". Programming languages are broadly categorized into three types −

Machine level language
Assembly level language
High-level language
object oriented programming:Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.<br>
procedure oriented language:It is defined as a programming language derived from the structure programming and based on calling procedures. The procedures are the functions, routines, or subroutines that consist of the computational steps required to be carried. It follows a step-by-step approach in order to break down a task into a set of variables and routines via a sequence of instructions.

During the program's execution, a procedure can be called at any point, either by other procedures or by itself. The examples of procedural programming are ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, and C.

As compared to object-oriented programming, procedural programming is less secure. Procedural programming follows a top-down approach during the designing of a program. It gives importance to the concept of the function and divides the large programs into smaller parts or called as functions. Procedural programming is straightforward. Unlike object-oriented programming, there are no access modifiers introduced in procedural programming.

Object-oriented programming:
Object-oriented programming is a computer programming design philosophy or methodology that organizes/ models software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic. It includes two words, "object" and "oriented". In a dictionary object is an article or entity that exists in the real world. The meaning of oriented is interested in a particular kind of thing or entity. In layman's terms, it is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity.

The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is said to be the first truly object-oriented programming language.<br>
compiler  and interpreter:Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs.
Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. A compiler takes in the entire program and requires a lot of time to analyze the source code. Whereas the interpreter takes a single line of code and very little time to analyze it.
Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.
A compiler displays all errors after compilation. If your code has mistakes, it will not compile. But the interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.
Interpretation does not replace compilation completely.
Compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons like faster performance and smaller memory footprint.
JavaScript:JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).was initially implemented in Netscape Navigator, which was the most popular browser at the time. The language was quickly adopted by Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer. Due to its simplicity of usage and the fact that it was the only client-side scripting language available at the time, JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers.

JavaScript gained popularity during the ensuing years and was used to develop a wide range of web applications, such as online games, dynamic menus, and form validation. ECMAScript 4, a new version of the language, was planned in 2002, however, it was ultimately abandoned because of conflicts among the various browser vendors.

With an estimated 95% of websites utilizing it in some capacity, JavaScript is currently one of the most popular programming languages in use worldwide. It is employed not only in web development but also in the creation of server-side applications, desktop and mobile applications, and even the programming of robots and other hardware.
implementation of JavaScript:Now we want to implement our interface, in a simple example we will create an object using an object literal and see if we are able to implement our interface.

First, we create a Ford object, then we will attempt to implement it against our Car interface:

As we see from the comment above, this throws an error. Let’s look back at our Car interface:

We can see that while all the properties are present, strict mode is also true, meaning that the additional property fuelType causes an error to be thrown. Additionally, although we have a passengers property, it is not an array.

In order to correctly implement the interface, we remove fuelType and change the value of passengers so that it is an array containing objects that implement the Passenger interface:

JavaScript:-----
We use implements for implementing interfaces. Interfaces are like contracts and define a set of rules that an object must follow. If a class implements an interface then it has to implement all of the properties and methods defined in the interface.<br>
Create interfaces to enforce, remove, or rename properties of objects
Use in testing to easily verify object shapes and property types
Effortlessly and safely parse API responses by renaming or removing properties
Errors and warnings are suppressed 
mplement.js is a library that attempts to bring interfaces to JavaScript in the form of runtime type-checking.

Simply define an interface using Interface and call implement on an object to check if it implements the given interface.
Implementing classes
Since class is just a constructor function waiting to be called and not truly an object, we cannot check if it implements a given Interface. Also, due to the dynamic nature of class properties, even once instantiated we cannot reliably implement interfaces against them.

Interface
Takes a string to be used as a name, if none is provided it generates a uuid, returns a function that accepts an object where all the keys are type objects, and returns an Interface. The Interface is to be used by implement.
features of JavaScript:JavaScript is equipped with control statements like if-else-if, switch-case, and loops like for, while, and do-while loops. These control statements make it a powerful programming language, enabling its user to write complex logic.<br>
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for front-end web development but can also be employed on the server side (Node.js) and in other contexts. It offers a wide range of features that contribute to its popularity and usefulness. Here are some notable features of JavaScript
Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The type of a variable can change during runtime.

Interpreted Language: JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed without the need for a compilation step. This enables rapid development and testing.
Closures: JavaScript supports closures, which allow functions to maintain their own scope even after they have finished executing. This is particularly useful for creating private variables and data encapsulation.

Prototype-based Object-Oriented Programming: JavaScript uses a prototype-based model for object-oriented programming. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, making it a flexible approach to defining and extending object behavior.

Event-Driven Programming: JavaScript is often used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. Its event-driven architecture allows developers to attach event listeners to elements on a webpage, enabling responses to user interactions.

Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript uses asynchronous programming to handle tasks that might take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or performing animations. This is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.

First-Class Functions: In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a cross-platform language that can run on various devices and operating systems.

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to dynamically modify the content and structure of web pages in response to user actions.

Libraries and Frameworks: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify the development of complex web applications.

Module System: With the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript added support for a module system that allows developers to organize code into reusable modules, making code maintenance and sharing more efficient.

Arrow Functions: ES6 introduced arrow functions, which provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions. They automatically bind the value of this based on the surrounding code.

Template Literals: ES6 also brought template literals, which enable string interpolation and multiline strings, making it easier to create dynamic and formatted strings.

Strict Mode: JavaScript's strict mode helps catch common coding mistakes and "silent" errors by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling rules.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is closely related to JavaScript's object syntax. It's widely used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.

These are just a few of the many features that make JavaScript a powerful and flexible programming language for web development and beyond.
